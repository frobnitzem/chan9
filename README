Go9P is a pure go implementation of the 9P and 9P2000 (Styx / dot u extension) protocols.

  For a general introduction to the 9p protocol and philosophy see:
http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/5/intro

== What's Included ==

  The basic package 'code.google.com/p/go9p/p' defines the Qid, Dir and Fcall
structures.  These (mainly the latter) are used for (de)serializing
(to)from the 9P 'on-wire' protocol representation.
The Pack/Unpack functions can be listed with 'grep "func Pack" *.go'.

  Three independent libraries (each with more/less working examples)
are built on the basic package.  My favorites are the ramdisk server and
cl shell-like client.  The clnt and chan9 libraries both implement
basic client functionality for talking to network servers,
such as would be expected on a Plan9 system (or via plan9port & co.).
The chan9 library adds namespace functionality including mount and bind
for re-organizing the file heirarchies of multiple servers.

  9P is /the/ network protocol used by the mythical Plan9 operating system.
The big idea is that all resources, networked or local, can be represented as read/write
operations on named hierarchies of objects.  Accessing those should be just as easy as
accessing a file, and it shouldn't make any difference if the file represents a local
or remote resource.  For modern re-inventions of this, see REST API design and FUSE.
Although revolutionary in its scope, the OS was not initially released open
source and required some effort in porting existing software, hindering
widespread adoption.  Its relatively small following led Eric S. Raymond, one of its more vocal
designers, to lament that "the most dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing
codebase that is just good enough.".
After the decision to leave the personal computer
and Unix networked server markets in 1996, AT&T divested the National Cash Register
Corporation and spun-off Bell Labs as Lucent Technologies, Lucent gave Plan9 a back-seat and
development slowly declined.  In 2002, Lucent made its last (4th edition)
release of the Plan9 OS.  This coincides with the date that Rob Pike moved from
Lucent to Google.  Its major issue is the lack of support for most
hardware.  It spewed some random garbage and ground to a halt during boot on my system.

  In 2011, a fork of the slowly developing v4 was made to allow faster
development, addition of new hardware support, and a re-write of
the fossil filesystem to the "Cached Write Once Read Many Filesystem."
(http://www.sdtimes.com/link/35742)  All I know is that this one did
boot on my (ca. 2002) hardware.

  It's no doubt that the plan9 philosophy is perfectly suited for cloud
computing.  Efforts in this direction have been made by go9p's
originator Andrew Mirtchovski (http://mirtchovski.com/p9/9grid/).
